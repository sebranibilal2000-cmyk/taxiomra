/**
 * Canonical consolidation map (SEO step 2).

 * The site grew several URLs that target the exact same query intent
 * (e.g. /cities/city-jeddah, /cities/jeddah and /taxi-jeddah). Those duplicates
 * compete with each other in Google (keyword cannibalisation) and split link
 * equity. Every key below is a duplicate URL that now 301s to the single
 * canonical page listed as its value, and is excluded from every sitemap.
 *
 * Paths are locale-less; the redirect keeps the visitor's locale prefix.
